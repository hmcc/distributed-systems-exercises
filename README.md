# distributed-systems-exercises

A list of starter exercises for Distributed Systems, inspired by reading lists like [awesome-distributed-systems](https://github.com/theanalyst/awesome-distributed-systems), but with a more practical focus.

The exercises are taken from various university courses on Distributed Systems. I don't plan to follow the instructions exactly as given - they may rely on tools that aren't available outside the university, and they use a variety of languages where I'd prefer to stick to one or two. However, I still find them useful to provide a bit more structure to each task.
